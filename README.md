CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    position VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    hire_date DATE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- MySQL Server 5.7 or higher
- MySQL JDBC Driver (Connector/J)

### Database Setup
1. Install and start MySQL server
2. Create the database and table:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE company_db;
USE company_db;
-- Run the SQL script from employees_db.sql
```

### Application Setup
1. Download MySQL Connector/J and place the JAR file in the `lib` directory
2. Update database credentials in `DBConnection.java`:
```java
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/company_db";
private static final String USERNAME = "your_username";
private static final String PASSWORD = "your_password";
```

### Running the Application

#### Using Command Line:
```bash
# Compile all Java files
javac -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.x.jar" *.java

# Run the application
java -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.x.jar" EmployeeApp
```

#### Using VS Code:
1. Configure the JDBC driver in your project classpath
2. Run `EmployeeApp.java` as a Java application

#### Using IntelliJ IDEA:
1. Add the MySQL JDBC JAR to project libraries
2. Run the `main` method in `EmployeeApp.java`
